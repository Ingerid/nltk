"""
NB Uttale is a Norwegian pronunciation dictionary,
with orthographic wordforms in the bokm√•l written standard,
and phonemic transcriptions for the Eastern Norwegian dialect in NoFAbet, an adjusted version of ARPAbet.
There are 819856 word-transcription pairs (WTP) in the lexicon.

The code here has been copied from the cmudict CorpusReader and adjusted to fit NB Uttale.

File format:
Each line consists of a lower case or title case word (e.g. proper names), and its transcription.
Multiword expressions are written with tilda (~) between the words.
Vowels are marked for stress (1=primary, 2=secondary, 0=no stress).

Example:
ordbok  OO2 R B OO3 K
over~bord       OA3 V AEH0 R ~ B OO1 R
Cuba    K UU1 B AH0
